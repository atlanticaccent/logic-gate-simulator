# logic-gate-simulator

This repository is the solution as submitted for practical 4 of module CS2002 - Computer Systems, 2017-18.

The objective of this practical was to create a program capable of simulating a stablising digital circuit from a given circuit description, whilst also testing understandings of logic, circuits and gates, and c programming concepts.

A copy of the report submitted with this practical is also included - named "CS2002-W09-Practical-Report.pdf" - detailing various design decisions, compilation instructions and testing methods.
